## Fansubbing

This repository contains the subtitles and encoding scripts of some of the releases that I've worked on. Most of them are available either on Nyaa and AnimeBytes, muxed with standard encodes, or on AnimeKaizoku, muxed with mini-encodes. 

The ones that are not released are either dropped, stalled or a work in progress. You're free to use any part of this repository as you wish but I would request that you provide credit where it's due.

The tag in front of each folder denotes the group under which the scripts have been or will be released. The tag at the end, if any, reffers to the status of that release.

You can find me in the [Kaizoku Network Server](http://discord.animekaizoku.com/) and the [AnimeKaizoku Telegram Chat](http://telegram.animekaizoku.com/) or you can personally reach out to me at notdedsec#6125 on Discord and @notdedsec on Telegram.
